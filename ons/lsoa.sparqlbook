If the geometrical boundary changes, then a new code is always issued, but occasionally other non-essential properties are changed without replacing the code.\n\nSo the only way to do it with the information currently held in statistics.data.gov.uk is to include the knowledge that the highest-number code of LSOA used in 2011 was E01033768\n\nSo this query finds all the codes with numbers up to that one, but excluding those which were terminated at the time the 2011 census codes were defined."
